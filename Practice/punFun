This is a poem. I declare it so.
What are we to write?
What are we ever to write?
Poety, they say.  Write poetry!
But poetry of what sort?  
Of mist and cloud? 
Of clod and dirt?
Nay, say I: puns.
Says Watler Redfern: To pun is to treat homonyms as synonyms.
But how much more wonderful if the homonym IS the synonym.
The dog speaks and covers the tree.
The bear is naked.
The robbers break into the bank to steal the lute.
The golfer gets the ball into the hot drink.


I wasn't originally going to get a brain transplant, but then I changed my mind.
I wondered why the baseball was getting bigger. Then it hit me.
